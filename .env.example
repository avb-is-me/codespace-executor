# Execution Mode
# Set to 'true' to use Docker-based execution with complete network isolation
# Set to 'false' or omit to use standard spawn-based execution
DOCKER_EXECUTOR=false

# When DOCKER_EXECUTOR=true:
# - All code execution happens in isolated Docker containers
# - Complete network isolation (networkMode=none)
# - Environment variables (including KEYBOARD_*) are passed to containers
# - 100% network blocking - impossible to bypass
# - Blocks Python exec, curl, wget, and all network access

# When DOCKER_EXECUTOR=false (default):
# - Standard spawn-based execution (faster)
# - No Docker required
# - Module patching can be used for network control (optional)

# Example KEYBOARD_* credentials (passed to both modes)
# KEYBOARD_STRIPE_KEY=sk_test_...
# KEYBOARD_AWS_KEY=...
# KEYBOARD_OPENAI_KEY=sk-...

# Other environment variables
# NODE_ENV=production
# PORT=3000
